# Newspaper/WebPortal Ad Selling Wordpress Plugin
Based on Woocommerce API and ACF - works only with WooCommerce and Advanced Custom Fields.
This is only a publisher plugin - it needs a central server from my second repository to work as a whole:

Wordpress Plugin for Traditional Newspapers/News Web Portals to sell your ad space.
1. Save what type of ad space do you have in your traditional newspaper and on your news portal, set a price for every space separately.
2. Check orders from ad buyers, and accept it, or send modificated offer with different publication time for every ad.

Now, ad buyers see what type of ad spaces they can buy in your newspaper.
Want to sell adspace in your web portal ? No problem, go to menu and click on Webportal Pricing Page.
Here the schema is similar, but created for webportal in mind.

When ad buyers choose what they need, a new order will come to your Orders Page. 
You can change the parameters of your offer, if ad space and publishing dates are reserved by other buyers, and resend this new offer to the client.

When you do that, an email with new offer is sent to the client.
Now you wait, for client acceptance or rejection.
